# coin-change-problem

About

Group1CoinChange is a group project by Rosa Tung, Sam Nelson and Kara Franco. This project implements three solutions to the Coin Change Problem by using the divide and conquer algorithm, the greedy algorithm and the dynamic programming algorithm. 


A user can input a testfile into the program to test the three algorithms on the given arrays of coins and A in the testfile. The output from the project is the results from each algorithm, including the coins used to make change and the number of coins. The results can be found in a new file created in the directory named [yourTestFile]change.txt. 


To Run

To run this project, place the following files into a directory along with the .txt file that you wish to test the algorithms against.
main.cpp
yourTestFile.txt
filter.cpp
filter.h
algos.cpp
algos.h
makefile

Next, run the makefile to compile by entering “make” (without the quotes “ “) into the flip server. 


Then write “main” (without the quotes “ “) into the flip server.


Follow the instructions that the program gives you

** be sure to enter the filename without the .txt extension **

Results can be found in the [yourTestFile]change.txt found in the directory. 

Extra

Inside the TestFile folder, there are .txt testfiles and result files for viewing and testing. We suggest using the test.txt file or changeSlow test files to run with Algorithm 1. You will have to comment out Algorithm 1 to run the other testfiles.
